# CaptureAIT

**CaptureAIT** is a competitive mobile game where players compete to locate specific physical objects and capture photos of them within a given time frame. Using AI, the system detects the presence of these objects in the photos and awards points based on the speed of discovery relative to other players. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!

## About the Project

CaptureAIT aims to combine real-world exploration with AI-powered object detection for a unique, interactive gaming experience. The game requires participants to search for four specific objects and take photos of them. The system utilizes the COCO neural network model to identify objects in the images and score players based on their speed in finding each item.

This repository contains the core code for the Android client and Python server; however, the Firebase database is not included, as players are encouraged to set up their own Firebase integration.

## Technologies

This project uses:

- **Android Client**:
  - Developed in **Java** using **Android Studio**.
  - HTTP requests powered by **OkHttp**.
  - Real-time communication via **Socket.IO**.
- **Python Server**:
  - Built with **Flask** to handle incoming HTTP and WebSocket connections.
  - Uses a COCO neural network model to detect objects in player photos.
- **Database**:
  - **Firebase** (not included) is required for data storage and retrieval. Anyone interested in testing the project can easily set up Firebase using Android Studioâ€™s built-in integration wizard.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CaptureAIT.git
   cd CaptureAIT
   ```
2. **Android Client**:  
   - Open Android Studio, load the project, and set up Firebase by following the integration steps provided by Android Studio.
   - Add your Firebase project configuration file (`google-services.json`) in the appropriate directory to enable Firebase functionality.

3. **Python Server**:  
   - Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
   - Install required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Start the Flask server:
     ```bash
     python server.py
     ```
## Usage

- **Start a New Game**: Players can initiate a new game session through the Android app.
- **Object Detection and Scoring**: As players upload photos, the server checks for the specified objects using the COCO model and calculates points based on the speed of identification.
- **Winning the Game**: At the end of the game session, the player with the highest score is declared the winner.
